    <h1>Geo Interactive – Game Partnership Terms of Service (TOS)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Geo Interactive, we value collaboration, creativity, and mutual respect. This Terms of Service (“TOS”) governs the relationship between Geo Interactive and all partners involved in game development projects (“Partners”). These rules ensure fairness, clarity, and a smooth development process.</p>

    <h2>2. Collaboration & Communication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creative Freedom:</strong> All partnerships are considered creative collaborations. Ownership, leadership roles, and other structural details must be explicitly agreed upon by all parties before development begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Partners must maintain open and respectful communication with Geo Interactive and their development teams. Regular check-ins are encouraged to facilitate support and early resolution of challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Project Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-Commercial Focus:</strong> All partnered projects must remain non-profit and free-to-play unless Geo Interactive grants specific written approval for monetization.</li>
      <li><strong>Branding & Credit:</strong> All partnered games must visibly include Geo Interactive branding (logo and mention). Proper credit must be given to all contributors who provide meaningful input or work.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress Updates:</strong> Partners are encouraged to provide weekly or bi-weekly progress updates, either in writing or via meetings, to support tracking and feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope & Timelines:</strong> Projects must define a clear scope and target timeline. Delays are allowed but must be communicated promptly to allow for expectation adjustments.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Access:</strong> Geo Interactive may request access to project builds, assets, or source files for quality assurance, bug testing, or internal review. Such materials will not be reused or shared externally without explicit permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Team Roles & Conflicts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Team Overlap & Roles:</strong> To prevent role overload and split commitments, Partners must notify Geo Interactive before assigning any Game Coordinator (GC) or Partnership Creator (PC) leadership or co-ownership roles in other active partnered projects across any teams or games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Breach & Termination</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rule Violations:</strong> Failure to comply with these partnership rules may result in reduced support, temporary suspension, or termination of the partnership.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair Warnings:</strong> Geo Interactive aims to resolve issues collaboratively with warnings where appropriate. Immediate termination may occur if violations are severe, intentional, or harmful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. General Provisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These terms may be updated periodically. Continued partnership constitutes acceptance of any changes.</li>
      <li>Partners must act in good faith and with professionalism throughout the collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>By entering into a partnership with Geo Interactive, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to abide by these Terms of Service.</strong></p>
