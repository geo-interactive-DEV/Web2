    <h1>Geo Interactive – Terms of Service (TOS)</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Geo Interactive! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are the rules for using anything created or managed by Geo Interactive, including our websites, games, apps, Discord servers, and other community platforms (“Services”).</p>
    <p>Geo Interactive is a group of developers and creators, not a registered company. By using our Services, you agree to follow these Terms. If you don’t agree, you must not use our Services.</p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Geo Interactive is a collaborative, creative group. We make games, websites, events, and online experiences for the community. While we may accept donations or offer digital content, we’re not a formal company, and nothing here forms a business contract.</p>

    <h2>2. Age and Access</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services.</li>
      <li>If you’re under 13, you're not allowed to join or access our content.</li>
      <li>We may ask for your date of birth to verify your age.</li>
      <li>If we discover you are underage, we may ban your account or delete your data.</li>
      <li>Some platforms (like Discord or Roblox) have their own age rules — you must follow those too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Account and Safety</h2>
    <p>Some parts of our Services (e.g. games or Discord) may require you to create an account or profile. By doing so, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use real, honest information (no fake names or pretending to be someone else).</li>
      <li>Keep your login secure.</li>
      <li>Not share your account unless allowed by the platform.</li>
      <li>Take responsibility for any actions made under your account.</li>
      <li>If someone uses your account to break the rules, you are still responsible unless proven otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Community Rules</h2>
    <p>To keep things safe and fun, you agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Break the law or the terms of services of platforms we use.</li>
      <li>Harass, bully, threaten, or insult others.</li>
      <li>Use slurs, hate speech, NSFW content, or anything unsafe for kids/teens.</li>
      <li>Spam or flood chats, comments, or servers.</li>
      <li>Share cheats, exploits, viruses, or harmful content.</li>
      <li>Attempt to hack or reverse-engineer our games or platforms.</li>
      <li>Pretend to be staff or moderators when you're not.</li>
      <li>Use bots or scripts to gain unfair advantages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may warn, mute, kick, or permanently ban users who break these rules.</p>

    <h2>5. Moderation and Staff</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staff decisions are final.</li>
      <li>You may appeal bans or ask questions respectfully.</li>
      <li>Report abuse or bugs via proper channels.</li>
      <li>Abusing the report system or lying in appeals may result in longer bans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Digital Items, Donations, and Purchases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Virtual items, passes, or donations are not real money and have no cash value.</li>
      <li>No refunds are required unless legally obligated.</li>
      <li>Items may be changed or removed as we update or shut down games.</li>
      <li>Donations support the project but do not grant ownership or authority.</li>
      <li>Chargebacks or abuse may result in bans or restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must own or have permission to submit content.</li>
      <li>You allow us to use or modify your content in our projects.</li>
      <li>You don’t get ownership, credit, or payment unless we offer it.</li>
      <li>We can reject or remove content at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Our Content and Rights</h2>

      <li>You may not copy, sell, or reupload our content.</li>
      <li>You may stream, record, and make respectful fan content with credit.</li>
